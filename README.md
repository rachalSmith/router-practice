A simple app to practice using React Router (v5) and Semantic UI React.

## Description

Using the Pokeapi, an app with couple of pages and dynamic routes. 

Styling Trigger warning: 
this is a practice project, I was testing the different ways of styling with Semantic UI React. 
Once I felt that I understood how something worked I moved on. 
This project looks horrible.

```
#### Run React dev server (http://localhost:3000)
